## What I have done:

1. Added Dropzone to drag and drop image on desktop, on mobile it work as button.
2. Added mobile UI (at least basic support)
3. Added loader spinner to show while waiting for Model to load or to fetch data.
4. Add custom hook to fetch dog images urls and process different responses states.
5. Added different test messages for response status.
6. Added cache for fetched advices, it's based on search url (requires tweeking).
7. Added basic tests.
8. Used simple css files to structure styling.
9. Added some Types where needed.

## What else could/should be done:

1. Make basic fetch hook, not advice specific and functional wrapper for advices.
2. Split components even more.
3. Add styles, use styled-components.
4. Add more tests.
5. Improve lazy loading.
6. Generally there are a lot of room for improvement I hope we can discuss it togther (some stuff was left intentionally)
